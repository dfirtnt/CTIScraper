    author: The DFIR Report
    
    Additional Context:
    The Interlock RAT PHP variant uses sophisticated process chaining techniques:
    - PowerShell spawns PHP from \\AppData\\Roaming\\php\\php.exe
    - PHP loads configuration from .cfg files
    - Registry persistence via HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run
    - Network communication through trycloudflare.com domains
    
    Hunting Indicators:
    - Monitor for PowerShell spawning PHP processes
    - Check for unusual file creation in AppData directories
    - Look for registry modifications to Run keys
    - Monitor network connections to suspicious domains
    
    MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:
    - T1059.001: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
    - T1547.001: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys
    - T1090.004: Proxy: Domain Fronting

    Threat Intelligence: Recent RDP Exploitation Campaign
    
    Summary: Attackers are using password spraying against RDP servers to gain initial access.
    After successful authentication, they create scheduled tasks for persistence and use
    process injection techniques to evade detection.
    
    Key Indicators:
    - RDP brute force attempts from multiple IP addresses
    - Scheduled task creation with unusual names
    - Process injection using PowerShell
    
    MITRE ATT&CK: T1021 (Remote Services), T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job), T1055 (Process Injection)
    
    Hunting Guidance: Monitor RDP logs for multiple failed attempts, check for unusual scheduled tasks,
    and look for PowerShell processes with unusual parent processes.
