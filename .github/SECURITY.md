# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

The CTI Scraper project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and what to expect from our security response process.

## üîç Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Support Level |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             | Full support  |
| 0.x.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited         | Critical fixes only |

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Reporting Method

Send security vulnerability reports to: **security@[your-domain].com**

### Alternative Reporting Methods

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab ‚Üí "Report a vulnerability"
2. **Direct Email**: Contact the maintainers directly
3. **Encrypted Communication**: PGP key available upon request

### Information to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., RCE, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Location** of the affected source code (file names and line numbers)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of concept or exploit code** (if available)
- **Impact assessment** - what an attacker could achieve
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

| Severity | Initial Response | Investigation | Fix & Release |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Critical | 24 hours         | 72 hours      | 7 days        |
| High     | 48 hours         | 1 week        | 2 weeks       |
| Medium   | 1 week           | 2 weeks       | 1 month       |
| Low      | 2 weeks          | 1 month       | Next release  |

## üîí Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

#### **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- ‚úÖ Pydantic models validate all input data
- ‚úÖ HTML content is sanitized using BeautifulSoup
- ‚úÖ URL validation using the `validators` library
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- ‚úÖ No default passwords or hardcoded credentials
- ‚úÖ Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Optional API key support for external services
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### **Network Security**
- ‚úÖ HTTPS-only connections for data collection
- ‚úÖ Configurable request timeouts
- ‚úÖ User-Agent identification
- ‚úÖ Robots.txt compliance

#### **Data Protection**
- ‚úÖ Content deduplication prevents data bloat
- ‚úÖ Configurable data retention policies
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data logged in production
- ‚úÖ Optional content encryption support

#### **Dependency Management**
- ‚úÖ Pinned dependency versions
- ‚úÖ Regular dependency updates
- ‚úÖ Automated vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ Security-focused dependency selection

### Security Scanning

We regularly perform:

- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety for known vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube analysis
- **Container Scanning**: If using Docker deployments

## üö´ Security Considerations

### Known Limitations

1. **Web Scraping Risks**: 
   - Content from external sources is sanitized but may contain malicious patterns
   - Always review collected content before analysis

2. **Database Security**:
   - Default SQLite configuration - secure file permissions recommended
   - No built-in database encryption (use filesystem encryption)

3. **Network Exposure**:
   - CLI tool not designed for network exposure
   - No built-in authentication for multi-user scenarios

### Recommended Security Practices

#### **For Development**
```bash
# Use virtual environments
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Regular security scans
bandit -r src/
safety check

# Secure dependency updates
pip-audit
```

#### **For Production**
```bash
# Use environment-specific configuration
cp .env.example .env.production

# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 .env.production
chmod 755 threat-intel

# Database security
chmod 600 threat_intel.db

# Regular updates
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### **For Deployment**
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
- Implement file system encryption for sensitive data
- Configure firewall rules to restrict network access
- Enable audit logging for security events
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Secure your deployment by configuring these environment variables:

```bash
# Database security
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db  # Use encrypted connections

# API security  
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your-key-here  # Rotate regularly
SHODAN_API_KEY=your-key-here      # Monitor usage

# Application security
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING                 # Reduce information disclosure
DEBUG=false                       # Disable debug mode
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secret-key    # Use strong random keys
```

### Content Security

```python
# config/sources.yaml security settings
source_name:
  config:
    max_articles: 100        # Limit resource consumption
    timeout: 30             # Prevent hanging requests
    rate_limit: 60          # Respect external services
    user_agent: "CTI-Bot"   # Identify your requests
```
