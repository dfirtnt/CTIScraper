# Improved Windows Malware/Threat Search Query
# Fixed backslashes, escaping, and search patterns
# Updated for case-insensitive search (no need for multiple case variations)

# Additional improvements to consider:
# 1. Add common malware indicators
# 2. Include registry path variations
# 3. Add process injection patterns
# 4. Include network connection patterns
# 5. Add file system manipulation patterns

# Alternative version with better escaping for specific search engines:

# VERSION THAT WILL WORK WITH YOUR BOOLEANSEARCHPARSER:
# This version uses only word characters and simple terms that the parser can handle
# Note: Case-insensitive search means we don't need multiple case variations

# RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR YOUR SEARCH FUNCTION:
# Break into multiple focused queries for better results:

# Query 1: Process names
"rundll32" OR "comspec" OR "msiexec" OR "wmic" OR "iex" OR "findstr" OR "powershell" OR "svchost" OR "lsass"

# Query 2: Registry and paths
"hkey" OR "hklm" OR "appdata" OR "programdata" OR "temp" OR "windows" OR "windir"

# Query 3: File extensions
"bat" OR "ps1" OR "lnk" OR "vhdx" OR "iso"

# Query 4: Technical indicators
"wbem" OR "EventID" OR "Event ID" OR "Command" OR "pipe" OR "MZ" OR "accepteula"

# NOTES:
# - All searches are case-insensitive (no need for multiple case variations)
# - Use quotes for exact phrase matching
# - Use OR for multiple terms (any can match)
# - Use AND for required terms (all must match)
# - Use NOT to exclude terms
